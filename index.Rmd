# The Growth of Noise in the Environment 

## **Noise:** *sound caused by human activity*

<br>

## We make a LOT of noise! 

<br>

## And it's EVERYWHERE 

---

# Effects of Noise on Wildlife 

## Extends beyond the physical footprint 
  - ### Road noise might be worse than roads 

<br> 

## Found throughout otherwise intact ecosystems 

<br> 

## Effects much different from natural sounds 

---
# Two Main Types of Effects 


.pull-left[
## Behavioural Effects

 - ### Movement patterns 
 
 - ### Communication strategies 
] 


.pull-right[
## Physiological Effects

  - ### Hearing loss
  - ### Increased stress hormones
]

# Overview of Noise Effects 

## Most research focused on behaviour 

<br>

## **Three main behavioural pathways** 

--

* ## **Disturbance:** perceived as a threat

--

* ## **Distraction:** attention diverted

--

* ## **Masking:** covers important auditory cues
