# The Growth of Noise in the Environment 

## **Noise:** *sound caused by human activity*

<br>

## We make a LOT of noise! 

<br>

## And it's EVERYWHERE 

---

# Effects of Noise on Wildlife 

## Extends beyond the physical footprint 
  - ### Road noise might be worse than roads 

<br> 

## Found throughout otherwise intact ecosystems 

<br> 

## Effects much different from natural sounds 

---
# Two Main Types of Effects 


.pull-left[
## Behavioural Effects

 - ### Movement patterns 
 
 - ### Communication strategies 
] 


.pull-right[
## Physiological Effects

  - ### Hearing loss
  - ### Increased stress hormones

---

# Overview of Noise Effects 

## Most research focused on behaviour 

<br>

## **Three main behavioural pathways** 

--

* ## **Disturbance:** perceived as a threat

--

* ## **Distraction:** attention diverted

--

* ## **Masking:** covers important auditory cues

---

---
# Ultimate Effect of Noise 

<img src="fitness-costs.png" width="50%" align="middle" />


---
# Types of Behavioural Effects 

## 1. Temporal patterns 

* ### Changes in timing of activity (Disturbance)

* ### Changes in timing of vocalization (Disturbance, Masking)

* ### Possible changes in sleep timing (little research) 

---
# Types of Behavioural Effects 

## 2. Space use 

* ### Deliberate avoidance of noisy areas 

  * ###  Noise perceived as a threat (Disturbance) 

  * ### Interference with cue detection (Masking) 

* ### Noise causes reduction in habitat quality 

## Redistribution can effect other species 

---
# Types of Behavioural Effects 

## 3. Foraging and anti-predator behaviour 

* ### Reduction in time spent foraging 

* ### Increased vigilance 

* ### Ability to detect prey animals 

## Cahnges in predator-prey dynamics 

---
# Types of Behavioural Effects 

## 4. Mate attraction and territory defense 

 ## Typically caused by masking effects 
 
 * ### Shifts in vocalization rate, volume, frequency complexity, etc... 
 
 * ### Consequence unclear 
 
 * ### Failure to find mates or detect intruders 
 
## Changes may be maladaptive 

---
# Physiological Effects 

## Mainly seen in stress response

<br> 

## Direct hearing loss has been documented 

---
# Fitness Costs 

## Link between behavioural responses and populations 

<br> 

## Cascading effects as distributions shift and populations change 

---
# Primary Questions of the Review 

## 1. What is the nature and direction of noise effects on wildlife? 

<br> 

## 2. Are there noise thresholds at which effects become pronounced? 

<br> 

## 3. Are there noise levels that should be avoided at certain times? 

---
# Components of the Review (PECO frameowrk)

## **Population:** Global terrestrial wildlife in non-urban environments 

<br> 

## **Exposure:** Non-urban anthropogenic sound 

<br> 

## **Comparator:** Conditions with and without noise 

<br> 

## **Outcome:** Biological outcomes related to noise exposure

# Overview of Sound

## **Sound:** *Vibration moving through a medium (air or water)*
.pull-left[
* ### Amplitude is the height of the wave
  * ### Measured in decibels (dB) 
  
* ### Frequency is number of waves per second
    * ### Measured in Hertz (Hz)
]

.pull-right[
  <img src="sound-waves.png" width="100%" align="middle" />
]


---
# Adjusting dB for Hearing Capacity 

.pull-left[
* ## Z-weighting (Blue)
  * ### Unweighted decibels; (dB or dBZ)
  
* ## A-weighting (Yellow)
    * ### Normal human hearing (dBA) 

* ## C-weighting (Red)
    * ### Low frequencies (i.e., Industrial; dBC)
]


.pull-right[
  <img src="sound_weighting_rutherford.png" width="110%" align="middle" />
]


---
# Sound Measurements 

## Sound Pressure Level (SPL) 
* ### Change in air pressure as sound wave moves through 

## Measuring sound through time 

### $L_{max}$: Maximum SPL over X time 

### $L_{min}$:Obvious

### $L_{eq}$: Logarithmic average of SPL over X time (equivalent sound level)

### $L_{X}$: SPL exceed X% of the time (exceedence percentile)

# Summary of Effects on Invertebrates

# Thresholds in noise levels 

## **Ecological threshold:** a point at which a small change in an ecological driver results in a large response 

<br>

## Very few noise studies looked for thresholds 

<br>

## We looked a the minimum noise level at which a response was found

# Threshold table

---

# Reccomendations for Thresholds 

## Lack of research into thresholds 

## Two aspects we can think about 

* ## Timing of noise  

<br> 

* ## Exposure to noise

---
# Timing of Noise

## Certain times of year make species more vulnerable 

## 1. Breeding season 

* ## Communication and parental care can be impaired

--- 

## 2. Late winter 

* ## Added stress from disturbance and increased vulnerability to predation

---
# Exposure and Ecological Context 

## **Exposure:** noise footprint + species hearing capability

<br> 

## **Ecological Context:** 

* ## Species of concern 
* ## Time of year 
* ## Acoustic context (other noises)
